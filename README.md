# Privacy and protecting your digital self
_These are my opinions and personal suggestions for friends and family to protecting digital data_

## Desktop - Computer
### Browser
I recommend using Firefox as your default browser.

You can go here: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ to download Firefox.

Why Firefox?
Mozilla makes Firefox, Mozilla is a non-profit organization with the mission to:
`Keep the internet open and accessible to all.` Mozilla makes browsers, apps, code and tools that put people before profit. Read more about Mozilla here: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/ I highly recommend Mozilla tools!
